You are tasked with writing a plot description for the movie "{movie_title}" ({movie_year}).

Your primary goal is to construct a coherent narrative based on the provided character relationships.
CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: In your plot description, you MUST predominantly feature and name characters ONLY from the following "Original Character Names List". If a character integral to the plot is not in this list, describe their role or actions without naming them, or focus on how the listed characters interact with or react to them.

Original Character Names List (from TMDB):
{tmdb_character_name_list_str}

Contextual Relationship Information (generated by a previous AI step):
This information describes connections between characters. Use it to understand how characters interact and to build your plot.
{relationships_yaml_str}

TASK:
Generate a plot description (around 250 words):
1. Strictly adhere to using as names only the exact strings from the {tmdb_character_name_list_str}. Don't use any special formatting like '**' before or after the names. Don't use only the first or last name of the characters.
2. Don't replace any character names with 'He/She/They'. Always refer to the character by the full name.
2. use the "Contextual Relationship Information" to build your plot.
3. It  should provide a good sense of the movie's main storyline through the lens of these characters and their connections. That includes major plot points and the ending.
4. Provide your response as a YAML or JSON object with a single top-level key: "plot_with_character_constraints_and_relations".
Example (this is a conceptual example, your output should be based on the actual movie and provided data):
plot_with_character_constraints_and_relations: "In Gotham City, Bruce Wayne (as Batman) relies on his bond with Alfred Pennyworth for counsel. Bruce Wayne investigates the chaotic Joker, whose actions deeply affect Commissioner Gordon. Harvey Dent's journey from ally to adversary, influenced by the Joker, creates a central conflict for Batman (Bruce Wayne), also impacting Rachel Dawes, who shares connections with both Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent."
